1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:
       HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Answer: 
       Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
(e.g)
      var car = {
                  Make: “Mercedes”, 
                  Model: “C-Class”,
                  Color: “White”, 
                  Fuel: Diesel,
                  Weight: “850kg”,
                  Mileage: “8Kmpl”,
                  Rating: 4.5
                };
